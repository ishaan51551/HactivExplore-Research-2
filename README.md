# Using the useCallback Hook for Repeated API Calls in React

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use the `useCallback` hook in React to efficiently make API calls more than once while avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of components. The `useCallback` hook is a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of your React applications when dealing with functions that depend on props or state.

In this project, we'll walk you through a step-by-step example of using `useCallback` to make API calls and provide a practical code example.
